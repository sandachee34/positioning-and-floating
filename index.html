                CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young <br />
                physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s <br />
                appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and  <br />
                equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics. <br />
<br />
                He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic  <br />
                particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he  <br />
                discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with.  <br />
                A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could  <br />
                have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a  <br />
                repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed  <br />
                of light for a prodigiously violent instant. <br />
<br />          
                If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the  <br />
                heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, <br />
                 warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the  <br />
                 wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but  <br />
                 would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean. <br />
<br />          
                “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of  <br />
                the page and drew a double box around it. <br />

          </p>
            <p>
                On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers <br />
                reported that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and <br />
                that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked <br />
                right.<br />

                Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic<br />
                 time with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led <br />
                 by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for <br />
                 Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-<br />
                 called gravitational waves — the signature of a universe being <br />
                 wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a <br />
                 trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought <br />
                 smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his <br />
                 colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.<br />

            <p>
                Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though<br />
                 many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be <br />
                 proved.<br />
<br />
                If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in <br />
                science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing <br />
                the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast <br />
                realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.<br />
                <br />
                Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, <br />
                extending 14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of<br />
                billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos<br />
                whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover,<br />
                beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of <br />
                other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta<br /> 
                water boiling over<br />
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>'As big as it gets'</h3><br />
            <p>
                In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating<br />
                 at energies forever beyond the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and <br />
                 yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the <br />
                 first direct observation of gravitational waves, which, according to <br />
                 Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should ruffle space-time.<br />
                 <br />
                Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who<br /> 
                was not part of the team, said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.”<br />
                <br />
                He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a <br />
                telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”<br />
                <br />
                The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of <br />
                microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a picture of the<br />
                 universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of <br />
                 the sun.<br />
                 <br />
                Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, <br />
                for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their <br />
                results in a scientific briefing at the Center for Astrophysics here on <br />
                Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.<br />
                
                Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one in 10 <br />
                million.<br />

                             tended his radio telescopes.<br />
<br />
                            Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the <br />
                            most popular variant of inflation, known as chaotic inflation, in<br />
                             1983, was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean last week when <br />
                             Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s <br />
                             team, knocked on his door with a bottle of Champagne to tell him <br />
                             the news.<br />

                    <p>“And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was <br />
                        a delivery but we did not think that we ordered anything, but I<br />
                         simply forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde<br /> 
                         wrote in an email.<br />
<br />
                        Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he <br />
                        was still hyperventilating. “Having news like this is the best way of <br />
                        spoiling a vacation,” he said.<br />
<br />
                        By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that <br />
                        inflation had been seen and news spread, astrophysicists <br />
                        responded with a mixture of jubilation and caution.<br />

                    Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the<br />
                     cosmic microwaves, which were discovered accidentally by Arno <br />
                     Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the <br />
                     Nobel Prize.<br />

                    Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these<br />
                     waves. He is one of four leaders of Bicep, which has operated a <br />
                     series of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the South Pole, <br />
                     where the thin, dry air creates ideal observing conditions. The <br />
                     others are Clement Pryke of the University of Minnesota, Jamie <br />
                     Bock of the California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of<br />
                      Stanford.<br />

                    So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do not <br />
                    bother asking about going any deeper into the past.<br />
<br />
                    We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very <br />
                    beginning, because inflation erases everything that came before it.<br />
                    All the chaos and randomness of the primordial moment are swept<br />
                    away, forever out of our view.<br />

                    “If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a Harvard<br />
                    -Smithsonian astronomer who was not part of the team, “you wind<br />
                     up at inflation.”<br />
